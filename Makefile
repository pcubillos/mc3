# Makefile - prepared for MC3

# `make` - Build and compile the MC3 executable and python extension..
# `make clean` - Remove all compiled (non-source) files that are created.

# If you are interested in the commands being run by this makefile, you may add
# "VERBOSE=1" to the end of any `make` command, i.e.:
#
# 		make VERBOSE=1
#
# This will display the exact commands being used for building, etc.
